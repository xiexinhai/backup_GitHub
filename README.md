# Compensate macros
**These macros are used for the compensation system in the g-2/EDM experiment**

The relevent macros can control the power supplies of three coils:
- Up-down (UD) coil
- Left-right (LR) coil
- Forward-backward (FB) coil

**Components**

- **PS_order**: Need to be firstly run! To fix the USB ID for three power supplies.
- **power_supply_control**: Command macros to control the power supplies. Also with the macros to save information of the power supplies.
- **monitor_PS_shift**: Some macros to draw plots for the output values of the power supplies. This can be run at the local computer.
- **cal_magnetic**: Macros to estimate B-field generated by the coils.
- **compensate**: Prototype of the compensation macros
- **MagnetControl**: Packages for ADC readout and PySerial interface.
